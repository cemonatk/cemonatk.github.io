While traversing around my archives, I came up with a CTF question that I prepared for Game of Pwners CTF 2017.

This was a preliminary question as far as I remember.

Here is the ctftime URL: 
[https://ctftime.org/event/406](https://ctftime.org/event/406)

I'd like to write down whatever I remember and all of the docs that I found.

**The question:**

```
He doesn't have an username on Telegram! We need his Caller-ID.

received_signal.zip
```

files in the zip file:

1) param.txt:

```
Bit_Period=.000001;                                                   
Amplitude=5;                                        
F1=(1/Bit_Period)*8;                           
F0=(1/Bit_Period)*2;                           
Fs=99000000;
T=Bit_Period/99:Bit_Period/99:Bit_Period;     
```

2) signal.dat:

```
   4.9597741e+00   4.8397435e+00   4.6418397e+00 ....TRIM... 
```

**Answer**

1) Open/import .dat file into Matlab.

2) FSK-Demodulate the signal by using parameters. (FSK is used to be using for CallerID). 
Output is in binary:
0110001001101001011101000010111001101100011110010010111100110010011010110011000101100010011100010110110101010010

You can use the following code in order to demodulate, it belongs to **md Salim Raza** (Remember hints)
[https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/44821-matlab-code-for-fsk-modulation-and-demodulation](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/44821-matlab-code-for-fsk-modulation-and-demodulation)
After a registration it's possible to download the matlab code.

3) Convert binary to ascii then obtain URL below:
bit.ly/2k1bqmR
It redirects to canyoupwn.me/we_eavesdropped_his_phone/

4) There is an XML file under this URL. You need to open it with wireshark but errors pop-up because of the syntax issues as shown below:


```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<dump>
<l1 direction="up" logicalchannel="128" error="0">
<l2 type="I" txseq="0"rxseq="1" p="0" data="03450404600200815E06813XXXXXXXXXA1150103" >


<!--
Caller is from turkey(+90), you need to get in touch.
Tell him: "Can you hear me now?"
-->
```

After fixing XML tags, you should be able to open.
Remember the 3rd Hint above...
Note: I replaced with XXX.. to be avoid of leaking his phone number.

5) When you open the XML with Wireshark then you should be able to see a GSM capture. When you open it, you should be able to see Caller-ID.

6) [Caner Koroglu](https://tr.linkedin.com/in/cnrkrglu) was supposed to be replying back the flag to you on Telegram :)
